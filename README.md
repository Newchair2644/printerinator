# Printerinator
A "3D printer" of sorts that functions similarly to a combination lock. Consists of 4 push buttons, 4x3 neopixel strips, a 16x2 lcd i2c display, and a buzzer. Each neopixel strip represents a "layer" of food. The idea is to illuminate certain parts of a physical display to make it appear as a dish. The lcd display then reflects that food, and the buzzer plays a fun sound. Invalid combinations are rejected with an error sound.
